# Automate Tinder swiping with Selenium

## Project description

- Main idea is to automate Tinder activities using Python and library called Selenium

- What is Tinder? 
    - We live in online world, everything happens online (learning, food ordering, meetings...), why wouldn't dating happen online?
    - This is mobile/web app where men meet women. There is option for each other to like other side. If there is mutual like, this is a match. Both parties (man and woman) get notified about new dating opportunity.
    
- What is Tinder problem?
    - There are far more men than women that use this app.
    - In my opinion, on one woman come 10 men.
    - Everyone should be shown, everyone should be exposed to other party. But, like always in economics, problem is regarding resources.
    - In this case, scarce economic/human resources are women. Why? Because demand is 10 higher that supply.
    - In other words, man cannot easily find woman due to simple reason - there is not enough woman on Tinder. 
    - When factors like taste, look, sympathy enter the game, it starts to be even more complicated to find girl that can be suitable to you.
    
- How Tinder solve this problem?
    - There is algorithm implemented that works as follows:
        - THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND ON TINDER, THE MORE GIRLS YOU LIKE - YOU WILL BE SHOWN TO HIGHER NUMBER OF GIRLS!
    - In other worlds, Tinder punish inactivity and gives high value to people who search actively. This is actually great life lesson. Gold is found by people who search for it!

- How my script can help you be more effective on Tinder?
    - You can automate boring job of swiping right and let robot does it for you.
    - You will like thousands of women per day and consequently will be shown to way more women than usual.
    - Of course, there will be matches you do not fancy, but you are free dislike them.
    - Using economic theory, you are benefited (shown to way more girls than w/o script) by paying cost (in our case some unwanted/non-ideal matches).

- How to use script?
    - Script works in semi-automated fashion
    - You will need to login manually
    - Start browser session
    - Go to Tinder website
    - Accept terms and conditions
    - Enter your credentials
    - Tinder will ask you to show you notifications about new matches. Disable it i.e. not allow
    - Start swiping by using Tinder script
    - It will show you soon after beginning two notifications. One regarding possibility to give superlike and one other notification (I forgot about what is this second notification). But goot thing is that it will not show it again
    - Enjoy!
